### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Zayd**](https://github.com/Zaid-B24), a final year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development & Game Development** 

I'm currently exploring new technologies and integrating them into projects with a focus on creating solutions for broader societal impact. Finding fulfillment in my work has always been a driving force for me.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games.
